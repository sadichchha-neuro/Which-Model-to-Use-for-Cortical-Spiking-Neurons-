# Analysis of "Which Model to Use for Cortical Spiking Neurons?"
## Eugene M. Izhikevich (2004)

This project was inspired by Izhikevich (2004), which discusses the trade-offs
between biological realism and computational efficiency in spiking neuron models.

Through implementing and comparing the LIF, Izhikevich, and Hodgkin–Huxley models,
this work demonstrates that while the Hodgkin–Huxley model offers detailed
biophysical accuracy, its computational cost limits large-scale simulations.
Conversely, the LIF model is efficient but biologically limited.

The Izhikevich model emerges as an effective compromise, capable of reproducing
diverse cortical firing behaviors with minimal computational complexity.
The results of this implementation-based comparison align closely with the
conclusions presented in the original paper.
